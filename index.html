    <h1>Happy Birthday!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the most epic birthday party! Get ready to eat cake like it’s your job.</p>
    <p>Don’t worry about the calories; they don’t count today! Just make sure to leave room for more cake!</p>
    <p>Remember, age is merely the number of years the world has been enjoying you. So eat, drink, and act like a kid again!</p>
    <p>Why did the birthday cake go to school? Because it wanted to be a smartie!</p>
    <p>Let’s party like it’s 1999—unless you were born in 1999, then let’s party like it’s your birth year!</p>
    <p>Here’s to another trip around the sun! Don’t forget to grab your party hats and a sense of humor!</p>
    <p>Thank you for joining the fiesta! If you can read this, you’re clearly at the wrong party... or you need more cake!</p>
